*Hashi-Corp Vault Helm Chart*

Vault is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API encryption keys, passwords, or certificates.

Vault provides encryption services that are gated by authentication and authorization methods. Using Vaultâ€™s UI, CLI, or HTTP API, access to secrets and other sensitive data can be securely stored and managed, tightly controlled (restricted), and auditable.
